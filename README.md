# Motivation
The goal of this project is to gather insight into the SNAP Benefits program while showcasing my data wrangling, statistic calculation, data visualization, and data analysis skills.

# Initial Questions
To guide my project I have decided to answer the following questions.
1. How has the national SNAP participation changed over time?
2. How has SNAP participation changed in each state over time?
3. How has the national average SNAP benefit changed over time?
4. How has the average SNAP benefit in each state changed over time?
5. Which states provide the largest SNAP benefit?
6. Which states have the highest SNAP participation
7. How did each state's SNAP participation change during 2008-2013?
8. How did each state's average SNAP benefit change during 2008-2013?

# Viewing Files
**The best way to interact with this project is by downloading the entire repository and opening files on your own computer. There are 3 parts of this project: data collection and wrangling, statistic calculation, and visualization and analysis. If you care to just see the visualization and analysis, there is a PDF of a Power BI printout.**

## Python Files
There are 3 Jupyter Notebooks. One is where I did all of the data wrangling, another for calculating all of the necessary statistics to answer the above questions, and the last one is to create visualizations of the statistics and answer the above questions.

To view the output of these notebooks I recommend you clone the repository and run the notebooks on your own computer.

## Power BI
There are 2 power BI related files. One is the actual Power BI file and another is a printout of the report generated using Power BI

## Tableau
To view the Tableau story either download the tableau file or visit my [tableau profile](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jacob.atnip#!/)
